#### What is **RFM** Analysis?
RFM Analysis stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary.
It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers. 

An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three metrics;

Recency (How long ago was the customerâ€™s last purchase).
-Frequency (How often the customers purchase from us).
-Monetary Value (How much a customer spends).
