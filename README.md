# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis-


### Business Request?

The organization is looking to lunch a new campaign on all products. We need you to segment our customers by finding the best and the worse group of customers for the campaign.

### Stakeholders Requirements?

1. Segment customers based on transaction history.
2. Identify top customers for targeted marketing.
3. Gain insights into customer segmentation to inform strategic decisions

### Technique Used: RFM Analysis

#### What is **RFM** Analysis?
RFM Analysis stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary.
It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers. 

An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three metrics;

-Recency (How long ago was the customerâ€™s last purchase).

-Frequency (How often the customers purchase from us).

-Monetary Value (How much a customer spends).


**The Query**

```sql
